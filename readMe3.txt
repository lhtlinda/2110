Program has a built-in adjacency list  with the capability to search for the path from one random person for another and
output the process. There are three available methods: breadth-first search, depth-first search and bidirectional breadth-
first search. Output shows the name of start and finish person with the number of steps taken. The person encountered on the 
path are also printed, the printing order is the direct path leading from start to finish person.
